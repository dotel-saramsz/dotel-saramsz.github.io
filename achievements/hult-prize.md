[Hult Prize](https://www.hultprize.org/) is an annual, year-long competition that crowd sources ideas from college students by challenging them to solve a pressing social issue. It is often touted as the biggest social entrepreneurship competition for students.

I participated in the **Hult Prize at Tribhuvan University** in 2017 where my team competed against student teams from various faculties inside Tribhuvan University. The winner of the competition earned a place at the regional finals in Dubai, UAE, the winner of which would march on to the global finals in New York, USA.

It was a surreal experience winning the Hult Prize at Tribhuvan University and participating at the Regional Finals in the breathtaking city of Dubai.

For the competition, we presented a prototype of an e-commerce platform targeted for the micro-entrepreneurs. Aptly named as **Product with a Story**, our main idea was to provide the entrepreneurs from marginalized community to directly sell their products to the customers where each product is accompanied with the background story of its creator. So, you would not just be buying the product but the heart and soul that went into making it.
