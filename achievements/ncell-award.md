Ncell, a leading telecommunication service provider in Nepal, awards scholarship to students from IOE, Pulchowk Campus as part of its CSR initiative. The award is given to the students who score the highest aggregate marks in a given calendar year (i.e. 2 semesters).

I was fortunate enough to win the award on 3 occasions during my undergraduate:

- 1st year (2016)
- 2nd year (2017)
- 4th year (2019)
