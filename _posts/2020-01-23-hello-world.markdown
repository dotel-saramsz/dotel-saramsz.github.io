Hey there, fellow human being (or a sentient AI)! 

Thank you for stumbling onto this part of the internet that I call my own.

You are not going to see anything interesting as of now but interesting things are in transit. 

I like to ramble about:

- Machine Learning / Deep Learning

- Philosophy

- Football (Soccer)

- Technology in General

If any of this interest you, stay tuned.
