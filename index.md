Hi, I am Saramsha. I am a Machine Learning Engineer by profession. 

Currently, I am working at my startup: **Upsilon Technologies** where we are building [Paana](https://www.paana.news/), an app that aggregates and summarizes news from various sources. Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com/). I completed by undergraduate in Computer Engineering from [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/) at Tribhuvan University in 2019. 

<span style="color:#0ddede"> I am actively looking to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science, preferably as a Research/Teaching Assistant. </span>

## Research Interests

I am interested in **Machine Learning**, particularly **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing**. Following is a list of areas that I have [conducted research](/publications.md) on or would like to work on in the near future:

- **Visual Scene Understanding:** Developing computer vision algorithms to make a computer understand visual scenes. Sources for such scenes can be (but not limited to) photograph, videos, satellite imagery, medical images, etc.  

- **Moving Object Detection and Tracking:** Enabling a machine to accurately identify moving objects like vehicles in a road and track their movement. 

- **NLP for low resource languages:** Exploring transfer learning and self supervised learning in NLP to bridge the resource gap for low resource languages like Nepali. 

- **Multimodal Deep Learning:** Integrating multiple sources of information like language and vision in a single learning task.

If you'd like to collaborate in any of the above, feel free to [reach out](/contact.md) to me.
