Hi, I am **Saramsha Dotel**. I am a Machine Learning Engineer based in Kathmandu, Nepal. 

I completed my undergraduate in Computer Engineering from **Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus** and I love combining software development with data science to create impactful digital solutions targeted specially for the developing countries. My research interests include:

- **AI for Social Good:** Application of Computer Vision techniques in humanitarian aid and disaster response.

- **NLP for low resource languages:** Exploring transfer learning and self supervised learning in NLP to bridge the resource gap for languages like Nepali.

- **Multimodal Deep Learning:** Integrating multiple sources of information like language and vision in a single learning task.

If you are working in or have interesting ideas or learning resources to share in any of the above, I would like to get in touch with you.

Apart from my professional interests, I am also curious to learn more about *astrophysics*, *economics and social science*, *philosophy*, *evolutionary biology* and *entrepreneurship*. People who know me are very well aware that rambling about these topics with a group of like minded people, in a calm and secluded hill station beside a fireplace, is my utopian fantasy.

And did I mention my love for football? I am a die hard supporter of **Liverpool Football Club** and occassionally pen my thoughts and experiences as a life-long follower of the beautiful game.
